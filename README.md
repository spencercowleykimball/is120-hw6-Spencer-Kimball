**Question**
* Explain the difference between Flexbox and Grid. What use cases is each one better suited for?
**Answer**
Flexbox allows you to change the flow direction within a container, whether you want it in a row or column format and if it goes left or right/up or down. Flexbox is good at arranging cards of different sizes.
Grid allows you to create where things should be located on the page given the grid template option. Grid is able to really create the page layout well, whereas using flexbox to create the space for header, nav, main, and footer would be overly complicated. Grid is better at arranging cards that would be of the same size.

**Question**
* Do you like Flexbox or Grid better? Why?
I do like using flexbox since so far I have only had to arrange cards on a page, and it hasn't really needed any complicated set of arrangements that grid could be used for.
